## Project Overviews with Phase-wise Tasks

### Deep Learning Model for LiDAR Data Processing

#### Phase 1: Literature Review
- Explore the usage of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and PointNet for processing LiDAR data.
- Investigate preprocessing techniques such as voxelization, point cloud downsampling, and data augmentation strategies.

#### Phase 2: Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Acquire publicly available datasets (e.g., KITTI, SemanticKITTI, NuScenes) and learn lidar data processing. 
- Implement point cloud normalization, noise removal, and data augmentation such as rotation, scaling, and flipping.

#### Phase 3: Model Development
- Design a deep learning model with attention mechanisms or multi-scale processing to handle the sparsity and irregularity of LiDAR data.
- Implement frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or TensorFlow 3D to construct and train the model.

#### Phase 4: Model Evaluation
- Use Intersection over Union (IoU), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and other metrics to assess the model's performance.
- Experiment with transfer learning from pre-trained models like PointNet++.

#### Phase 5: Reporting and Documentation
- Create detailed documentation outlining preprocessing steps, model architecture, training process, evaluation results, and potential applications.
